Thank you everyone for being here. 

I want to thank Jon and the rest of the organization team for continuing to put on an awesome conference. And thanks to Dan
specifically for the invite to keynote here today.

*Deep breath*

So I was just introduced, but I'd love to talk a little more detail about who I am. In some ways, these are affirmations.
As a speaker, this is my 10th conference talk. Many of those were here, at Pygotham. Mostly, I talk about games. Some
version of my making games talk has now been given at four different conferences, including PyTennessee, PyOhio, and PyTexas.
Games are one of my favorite things, and I built a career on that interest.

Two years ago, on this same stage, I gave a talk about my transition as a member of the New York python community. I was
an active member of NYC Python and Learn Python NYC when I realized I was trans and started my transition. In many ways,
the folks I thanked at the beginning of my introduction made it possible for me to be here in more than one way.

I've spent a lot of time volunteering and organizing in this community, and only recently stepped back from that role.

Bringing all of these facts together, I'm the author and co-maintainer of PursuedPyBear, an education focused game library.
I'm sure by now, you've all seen the stickers with our logo, and maybe one of my talks on the topic at other conferences.
If not, there'll be a PPB talk across the hall after the break, and I encourage anyone at all interested to attend.

*Deep breath*

So let's actually talk about success. I'll admit up front, that word is filled with fear for me. Over the years, I've spent
a lot of time failing in more ways than one. That's part of why I opened this talk discussing the more conventional kinds
of success I've managed in my life.

I want to call attention to that phrasing: Conventional success. Our society is built so that "success" comes with an implicit
meaning: Making more money. Gaining power. Getting prestige. It's getting a raise, being invited to keynote, it's getting
noticed by people.

? ? ? ?

But there's a different kind of success. That kind that comes when you get to pick what counts and make it to those goals.
It's like goal setting, but with an extra edge of dreaming.

I recently read a quote from Adam Savage:

> Life stories always look like straight lines from the vantage point of looking back,
but precious few really are.

He would tell you his wasn't, and I can tell you from where I'm standing that mine definitely isn't.
Yours probably isn't, either.

I stand up here, software engineer, open source maintainer and public speaker, but this wasn't my first choice in career.
Hell, it's not even my second or third. And I'll be honest: it probably won't be my last.

It actually started with a dream I know a lot of people have: I was going to be a professional author. I started at twelve,
where I wrote into notebooks and an old electric type writer my family owned. By that point I read voraciously and turned
around and wrote more.

It was a time I could be genuinely fearless in my art because I didn't know there was anything to fear.

As I got older, I joined writing groups, both online and offline. It was around that time in my life that I let in a
dangerous idea:

I considered myself "aspiring".

So did most of my friends. After all, we were aspiring for something. We wanted to be published. We wanted friends, *pause* and fans.
The thing is, we were putting in the effort every day. Writing the words, editing, studying. Writing as a profession is hard
and harrowing. And each and every one of us were doing it.

As my life story goes, though, this is only the beginning. I realized I was working very hard, and not getting closer to surviving
on my career path, so I started poking at other things.

My family has a long history of small business owners. My grandparents owned their own businesses, my mother has owned multiple as
well. I grew up aware of what it took to run a small business well enough to survive. So I made a decision, and changed my dream a
little. I decided I'd get into management, and maybe eventual ownership. I worked at game shops, and eventually was managing pretty
quickly. Eventually, I realized to go further, I'd need to go to college.

So I did. Went and got myself a business degree. I was still writing, in fact, being in a business program gave me an excuse to
study the industry of publishing in much more detail. And even better: I was in college during early years of the kindle,
so the industry was changing every quarter. I got to do research reports on new developments. I got to write about the
price fixing case with Apple and the Big Five. I also was running a semi-professional blog, and joining new writing groups,
this time with people whose names you might know. I also ended up editing on the side, helping people I'd known for years.

As I got close to graduating, I began looking for jobs. The problem: I graduated in 2012, and the recession was still ongoing.
Positions I would normally qualify for were asking for the next greater degree and more experience than I could have possibly had.
In addition, I was struggling with mental health.

A detail I left out is that I'm a domestic violence survivor. The many years of harm and the lack of professional help were taking
their toll on me. One day I looked at my writing career and realized I was never very happy writing. It wasn't the storytelling itself
but I found fiction was a chore to write, and worse to edit afterwards. So I made a decision.

I quit. Gave up writing all together. It hurt, at first. So much of my identity was wrapped up in being a writer.

*Deep breath*

I went back to business, and more importantly, found a sweet spot between business and tech that I found I was quite good at.
Specifically, I graduated with a Management Information Systems degree, and was trained to perform the role they used to call
"business analyst". Nowadays, we'd call them product owners or project managers depending on who you talk to. To romanticize it a bit,
we were the translators between the business and tech worlds.

The problem is, I was the very last graduate at my college with my degree. It was being phased out for other things, and business
analyst came to mean something very different not long after. And all of the positions I was trained to do, as I said, wanted more
experience, even for junior positions. Oh, and they wanted more technical backgrounds. With actual programming experience.

Enter Python.

I wrote my first line of Python in December 2012. Not because I wanted to be a programmer, but because I needed it.
Unsurprisingly if you think about it, I ended up loving Python. Only three months later, I wrote my first video game. It was pure
Python, all built on pygame. I was still looking for my career, but I'd found a pretty solid side gig.

I wrote a couple of small web apps as a freelancer, eventually moved to New York. But I still hadn't found a steady job.

Then a temp agency I was working with suggested I check out meetup for the Python group. I did, joined NYC Python and
Flask NYC that week. I went to my first meetup event not long after, and met the recruiter that got me my first software
engineer position.

I stayed active in the group, and not long after, I was encouraged by Paul Longston to submit a talk to the local Python conference.
I'd literally only been programming for two years at this point, there couldn't possibly be anything I could talk about. But I knew
Pygame, and he encouraged me to at least write the proposal. I did, with only hours from the deadline.

I got accepted, and so two months after my first real software engineering job, I was on a stage at PyGotham, talking at Pygame.

That first job was a lot of fun, I got to work on some cool projects, primarily the Topps trading card apps, including Star Wars
card trader.

We're going to skip ahead, but in summary, I stayed involved with the community, giving three more talks at PyGotham before today.
During that time, I started a project called PursuedPyBear. It's a game library that started as "here's some neat ideas I did
in this one game I built, I should explore that", morphed to help with the amount of boilerplate I was writing in Pygame, and
eventually gained the goal of being education friendly. That project is now three years old, and we have a logo, and Casey is
giving a talk about it across the hall after this and I'm so excited.

I opened this talk with thoughts about success, and about defining our own metrics for success. When my story started, success had
a few components:

1. I wanted to be a published author.
2. Preferrably making my living that way.
3. I wanted people to love my books the way I loved my favorites growing up.
4. And you know, it'd be cool to do a Star Wars thing one day.

So, here I am, thinking about my own success. Let's see some easy ones: Star Wars, I worked on a Star Wars thing!

I've got a library that people care enough about to give talks about it. I'd say that counts as #3.

I'm making a living using the same skills I used for 4 and 3, so I guess I've got #2?

But I never got published. Well, that was true, until recently. Last November, a friend of mine had a book in the editing phase, and
she suggested myself to do the technical vetting on her book. The editor reached out to me, and I took the contract.

So while I didn't write it, there's now a book on the shelves with my name in the credits. And you know what? I'm taking that as a win.

So here I am, a success by my own metrics. What the hell do I do from here?
