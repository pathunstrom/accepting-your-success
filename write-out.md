Thank you everyone for being here. 

I want to thank Jon and the rest of the organization team for continuing to put on an awesome conference. And thanks to Dan
specifically for the invite to keynote here today.

*Deep breath*

So I was just introduced, but I'd love to talk a little more detail about who I am. In some ways, these are affirmations.
As a speaker, this is my 10th conference talk. Many of those were here, at Pygotham. Mostly, I talk about games. Some
version of my making games talk has now been given at four different conferences, including PyTennessee, PyOhio, and PyTexas.
Games are one of my favorite things, and I built a career on that interest.

Two years ago, on this same stage, I gave a talk about my transition as a member of the New York python community. I was
an active member of NYC Python and Learn Python NYC when I realized I was trans and started my transition. In many ways,
the folks I thanked at the beginning of my introduction made it possible for me to be here in more than one way.

I've spent a lot of time volunteering and organizing in this community, and only recently stepped back from that role.

Bringing all of these facts together, I'm the author and co-maintainer of PursuedPyBear, an education focused game library.
I'm sure by now, you've all seen the stickers with our logo, and maybe one of my talks on the topic at other conferences.
If not, there'll be a PPB talk across the hall after the break, and I encourage anyone at all interested to attend.

*Deep breath*

So let's actually talk about success. I'll admit up front, that word is filled with fear for me. Over the years, I've spent
a lot of time failing in more ways than one. That's part of why I opened this talk discussing the more conventional kinds
of success I've managed in my life.

I want to call attention to that phrasing: Conventional success. Our society is built so that "success" comes with an implicit
meaning: Making more money. Gaining power. Getting prestige. It's getting a raise, being invited to keynote, it's getting
noticed by people.

? ? ? ?

But there's a different kind of success. That kind that comes when you get to pick what counts and make it to those goals.
It's like goal setting, but with an extra edge of dreaming. For me, I had a goal when I was 12: I'd become a published
author, and maybe work on a cool Star Wars project.
